'This function is part of the "clever" mechanism which would cycle through the PWA multiple times, re-writing
'new noise samples every cycle (at a relatively early but random location in the cycle) and taking advantage of
'the fact that while a PWA is playing, you can overwrite with no ill consequences; the overwrite is faster than
'the play speed, and so when the overwrite passes the point of play the sound just "seamlessly" switches over.
'This worked GREAT for broadband noise, with the caveat that calibration is a bit more variable on Gaussian
'noise than it is on uniform noise, so we had to find an "average" value to set the PA5 to (PA5 setting cannot
'be done on the fly, unlike the PWA overwrite).  Unfortunately, this did NOT work great for bandpass noise. The
'short explanation is that broadband noise is effectively a continuous series of "clicks" as it contains
'frequencies about the Nyquist.  One click is as good as another, or in words of wisdom, "You can't fool me,
'it's clicks all the way down!"  The transition is by definition unnoticeable.  But for our bandpass noise, the
'sound is filtered below the Nyquist, so if you zoom in on it, it is actually smooth.  Switching from one 
'bandpass sound to the next (and restarting the cycle on the PWA, for that matter) introduced a discontinuity,
'and, bam! a click every second.  So much for that.  And as long as we're developing a new method for doing BP
'sounds, we may as well do BB sounds in exactly the same way.
