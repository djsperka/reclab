# parameters for reclab stimuli
# Lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored. 
# Blank lines and lines with only whitespace are also ignored
# The first non-comment, non-empty line must have three things, 
# - a name for the stim set (this will be part of the data filename). Letters
# and numbers only, please, and no spaces!
# - output sampling rate in Hz, e.g. 10000
# - Total length of stim1 + pause + stim2 + padding (in seconds)
# Here's an example - stim set name is "StimSet1", sampling at 10kHz, for 3s.
# StimSet1 10000 3
# Of course an actual line would NOT include the #!!!
#
stim1 10000 3
#
#
#
# now additional lines define stimuli. 
# For the purposes of this file a "stimuli" consists of a stim for both 
# output channels. 
# The two channels are separated by a "|". If one of the two is not to be 
# used, the "|" must still be present. 
# Each channel is specified by the basename of a file (extension must be 
# ".num" containing integers, one per line. 
# TODO: WHAT IS RANGE?
