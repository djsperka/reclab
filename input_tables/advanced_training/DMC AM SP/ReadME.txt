These are the input tables for DMC starting 6/26/2017.  In order to make space and AM closer in difficulty, space files marked "all" were made more difficult by changing the speakers to the ones closest to the starting speaker.

In order to make AM easier, the files marked "all" were changed so that the frequencies increased by a factor of 1.3 (previously it was 1.2).

All these files were created by modifying the files found in the "Joe AM SP" folder.

7/5/2017: New additions - the files marked HIGH were created to fix DMC's bias to answer "down" more often than "up".  These files have 3 high value S2 to every 2 lower or equal value S1s.  In other words, 60% of the trials will be for the higher stimuli, whereas 40% will be for the equal or lower values.
